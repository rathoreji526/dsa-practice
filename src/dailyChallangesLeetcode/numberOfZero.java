/*
Given an integer array nums, return the number of subarrays filled with 0.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,0,0,2,0,0,4]
Output: 6
Explanation:
There are 4 occurrences of [0] as a subarray.
There are 2 occurrences of [0,0] as a subarray.
There is no occurrence of a subarray with a size more than 2 filled with 0. Therefore, we return 6.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,0,2,0,0]
Output: 9
Explanation:
There are 5 occurrences of [0] as a subarray.
There are 3 occurrences of [0,0] as a subarray.
There is 1 occurrence of [0,0,0] as a subarray.
There is no occurrence of a subarray with a size more than 3 filled with 0. Therefore, we return 9.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [2,10,2019]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no subarray filled with 0. Therefore, we return 0.
